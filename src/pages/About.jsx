                        <p>I was born and raised in Belgium where I grew up in a tech family who loves following new tech.
                            As a graphic designer, my father often make some web development.
                            But at this moment, I wasn't that interest into it and just often check some of his project.

                            After some years in art's college, I join tech's university during COVID.
                            Unfortunately, it was a difficult period and after 1 year and a half, I stopped and learn on my own.
                            When I understood basics of web languages, I join a formation locate in Belgium.
